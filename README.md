fooCam
======

fooCam takes multiple successive shots with different exposure settings. The
resulting images can be post-processed using image editors such as Luminance
HDR and Gimp to produce HDR images.

The app is published [on F-Droid][1]. Any thing you might see anywhere else
(including Google Play Store) is not from this repository.
